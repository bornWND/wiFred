. Use drilling jig to drill holes into housing
// end::drilljig[]
. Make cutout for micro USB connector
// tag::drilljig[]
. Use PCB to drill holes for LEDs next to micro USB connector (D101, D102)
// end::drilljig[]
. Install LEDs - long pin (positive) into square pad
  - Red LEDs at D101 and D205/D301 with 3mm spacers
  - Green LEDs at D102, D206/D302 and D207/D303 with 3mm spacers
  - White LEDs at D208/D304 and D209/D305 - choose where and how long they should stick out of housing
. Install potentiometer and loco selection switches
. Install direction selection switch and connect pins to PCB with short wires or cutoffs from LEDs
// tag::drilljig[]
. Make cut-outs in housing fit slide switches and flashlight LEDs
// end::drilljig[]
// tag::laser[]
. Drill holes in enclosure - 3mm for LEDs, 3.5mm for push buttons, 6.5mm for direction switch, 8mm for potentiometer, 1.5mm for slide switches and carefully file slide switch slots to match switch handles
// end::laser[]
. If push button switches are not installed: Place them on PCB (red at SW204, yellow at SW215) screw PCB into housing so they fit into the holes and solder them to the PCB
. Connect battery to P101 - BATT-connector
. Arrange battery so it fits between direction selection switch and PCB screws and glue into back housing

WARNING: Make sure red wire is connected to + and black wire connected to GND. Reversing the connection may destroy the wiFred.

WARNING: Make sure nothing pinches the battery. LiIon batteries are susceptible to mechanical damage.
